        <p>Answer: <br> var <br>
            var variable is functional scope.It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
            It can be declared without initialization.It can be accessed without 
            initialization as its default value is “undefined”.
        </p>
        <p><br> let <br> 
           let variable is block scope.It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
           It can be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without
           initialization otherwise it will give 'referenceError'.
            
            
        </p>
        <p><br> const <br>
           const variable is block scope.It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
           It cannot be declared without initialization.It cannot be accessed without initialization,

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
        <p>Answer: <br> Null <br>
            Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.
            null is also an object.<br><br>
            Example:<br> 
            var test1 = null;<br>
            console.log(test1);<br>
            // null
        </p>
        <p><br>Undefined<br> 
            Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.
            undefined is of type undefined. <br><br>
            Example:<br>
            var test2; <br>
            console.log(test2); <br>
            // undefined

        </p><br>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p>Answer: <br>
            REST API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. 
            It is an architectural style characterized by client-server separation, HTTP interface, and statelessness.
            It allows for platforms and systems written in different programming languages to interact with one another.
            For example, a client application written in C# can interact with an API server written in Java.
